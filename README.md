# mapsindoorsreactdashboard

this is heavily influenced by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoJ0Tv-BFcQ. I am taking this dashboard, adding some filter logic, adding a map, and also filtering the map based on the UI filter.

this repo is just for the front end, https://share.vidyard.com/watch/zvV52G8tH84Laq8wA2ifM2 to preview what this app does.

the map is provided via MapsPeople with their product MapsIndoors and is implemented with their SDK, www.mapspeople.com
